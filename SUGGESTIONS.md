## Suggestions

### Project
A lot is missing...

### README
- Missing files
  - INSTALL.md
  - TASKS.md

### INSTALL SCRIPT
none existing

### Ansible
- inventory full with details but clear who these detailed clients are
  - there are no instructions regarding the detailed clients either
- playbook seems to be written in correct manner, but you are using `reados.sh` which does not exists in the project

### OSChecker
script is far from posix complient, and it is also not used
